3. Proficiency in Jest , Enzyme , StoryBook Testing  [ Mandatory , at least 1.5 years ]
4. Experience with ignite framework is preferable : https://github.com/infinitered/ignite

We have a fully developed and functioning app, however have several key features still needing development, bug fixes and general app
optimization.  We work with Jira, Zeplin and Github, and are adamant about Test Driven Development and Git Flow so you will need to be
familiar with those.


Please message me and let me know if interested to proceed.
